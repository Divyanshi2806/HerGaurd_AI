# HerGaurd AI
HerGaurd AI is an agent-based women’s safety and health platform that moves beyond manual SOS systems by using context-aware AI reasoning to detect risk before emergencies occur. The system continuously evaluates user behavior, environment, and health context to identify intent mismatch, a key signal of vulnerability.

A dedicated Guardian Safety Agent securely manages authentication, trusted contacts, risk history, and alert escalation. Based on ethical autonomy rules, the agent decides when to observe, nudge, or notify trusted contacts through real-time communication channels.

The platform is built on a three-layer architecture: a Flutter mobile app for users, an application backend for workflow management, and a secure AI safety microservice for data, decision-making, and notifications. This design ensures privacy, auditability, and responsible AI operation.

HerGuide AI delivers proactive, intelligent, and ethical protection, turning women’s safety into a continuous, adaptive safety system rather than a panic-driven response.
